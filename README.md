# Inlang Demo

> :warning: inlang is a proof of concept and must not be used in production. It's in very early stage. Please give feedback in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/samuelstroschein/inlang/discussions).

## Getting Started

### 1. Use this template

Inlang is tightly bundled with your repository *(not the right approach from us? [Give feedback](https://github.com/samuelstroschein/inlang/discussions))*. Therefore, you have to create a repository to test inlang. The easiest way is to use this repo as template.

### 2. Create a new project in [inlang](https://app.inlang.dev)

With the following config: 

- project root path: empty.
- default locale: "en" 
- translation locales : "fr", "nl", "de", "da", "es"

### 3. Let the magic begin
1. run from the command line: 
> `npm install`

2. start the project server
> `npm run dev`

3. Refresh the inlang dashboard. Et voila, missing translations contains stuff you have to translate!

4. Commit your translations (top left corner)

5. Git Pull in your repository (to get the latest translations)

6. Done. You now have a multilingual app. Nice :)
